### Overview

`MatchingFrontier` implements the methods described in King, Lucas, and Nielsen (2017) for exploring the balance-sample size frontier in observational studies, a function the relates the size of a matched subset to the covariate balance attained. Included are function to create the frontier, visualize it, and estimate treatment effects along it. In addition, functions are included to export a matched dataset at a single point on the frontier and assess model dependence for a single treatment effect estimate. `MatchingFrontier` interfaces with `MatchIt` to provide additional tools for assessing balance in matched datasets and estimating effects after matching.

Below is an example of using the `MatchingFrontier` to examine the balance-sample size frontier for the effect of a job training program on earnings. See `vignette("MatchingFrontier")` for more information on the setup and a more detailed exposition.

```{r}
library("MatchingFrontier")
data("lalonde", package = "MatchIt")

mahal.frontier <- makeFrontier(treat ~ age + educ + race + married +
                                 nodegree + re74 + re75,
                               data = lalonde, 
                               QOI = "FSATT", 
                               metric = "dist",
                               verbose = FALSE)

mahal.frontier
```

Plotting the frontier provides a clear picture of the relationship between the number of units pruned in the matching and the remaining imbalance as measured by the average Mahalanobis imbalance.

```{r}
plot(mahal.frontier)
```

We can then estimate effects along the frontier.

```{r}
mahal.estimates <- estimateEffects(mahal.frontier, 
                                   base.form = re78 ~ treat,
                                   verbose = FALSE)
mahal.estimates
```

Finally, we can plot the estimates and their confidence intervals.

```{r}
plot(mahal.estimates)
```

Other tools include `generateDataset()` and `frontier_to_matchit()` for extracting a matched dataset at one point on the frontier and `modelDependence()` for computing model dependence bounds for a single estimate. See `vignette("MatchingFrontier")` for a more in-depth tutorial.
