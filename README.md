## [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://img.shields.io/cran/v/MatchingFrontier?color=952100)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MatchingFrontier) [![CRAN\_Downloads\_Badge](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/MatchingFrontier?color=952100)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MatchingFrontier)

### Overview

`MatchingFrontier` implements the methods described in King, Lucas, and
Nielsen (2017) for exploring the balance-sample size frontier in
observational studies, a function the relates the size of a matched
subset to the covariate balance attained. Included are function to
create the frontier, visualize it, and estimate treatment effects along
it. In addition, functions are included to export a matched dataset at a
single point on the frontier and assess model dependence for a single
treatment effect estimate. `MatchingFrontier` interfaces with `MatchIt`
to provide additional tools for assessing balance in matched datasets
and estimating effects after matching.

Below is an example of using the `MatchFrontier` to examine the
balance-sample size frontier for the effect of a job training program on
earnings. See `vignette("MatchFrontier")` for more information on the
setup and a more detailed exposition.

``` r
library("MatchingFrontier")
data("lalonde", package = "MatchIt")

mahal.frontier <- makeFrontier(treat ~ age + educ + race + married +
                                 nodegree + re74 + re75,
                               data = lalonde, 
                               QOI = "FSATT", 
                               metric = "Mahal")

mahal.frontier
```

    #> A matchFrontier object
    #> - quantity of interest: FSATT
    #> - imbalance metric: average pairwise Mahalanobis distance
    #> - treatment: treat
    #> - covariates: age, educ, race, married, nodegree, re74, re75
    #> - number of points: 137

Plotting the frontier provides a clear picture of the relationship
between the number of units pruned in the matching and the remaining
imbalance as measured by the average Mahalanobis imbalance.

``` r
plot(mahal.frontier)
```

We can then estimate effects along the frontier.

``` r
mahal.estimates <- estimateEffects(mahal.frontier, 
                                   base.form = re78 ~ treat,
                                   prop.estimated = .5,
                                   verbose = FALSE)
mahal.estimates
```

    #> A frontierEstimates object
    #> - quantity of interest: FSATT
    #> - model sensitivity method: none
    #> - number of estimates: 69
    #> - treatment: treat
    #> - covariates: age, educ, race, married, nodegree, re74, re75
    #> - outcome model: re78 ~ treat

Finally, we can plot the estimates and their confidence intervals.

``` r
plot(mahal.estimates)
```

Other tools include `generateDataset()` and `frontier_to_matchit()` for
extracting a matched dataset at one point on the frontier and
`modelDependence()` for computing model dependence bounds for a single
estimate. See `vignette("MatchFrontier")` for a more in-depth tutorial.

The work in this package is based off the following paper:

Balance-Sample Size Frontier in Matching Methods for Causal Inference.”
